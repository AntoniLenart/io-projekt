The speaker addresses a shift in focus for Facebook and Instagram towards prioritizing free expression. Initially, social media was built to give voices to individuals, but over the years, debates on online content harms, political pressures, and complex content moderation systems have led to excessive censorship and mistakes. To counteract this, the speaker outlines several changes:

1. Eliminate fact-checkers in favor of a community notes system akin to the platform X, aiming to reduce political bias and restore trust.
2. Simplify content policies by removing restrictions on sensitive topics like immigration and gender, allowing more diverse opinions.
3. Adjust enforcement strategies to focus on illegal and severe violations via filters, while relying on user reports for less severe issues, to decrease errors in content removal.
4. Reintroduce civic content amidst evolving cultural demands, while maintaining a friendly online environment.

These changes are designed to enhance free expression while responsibly managing harmful content.
